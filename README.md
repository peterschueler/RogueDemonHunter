## RogueDemonHunter

### Description

Demons. They have taken over the world. You need to stop them. But wait! You don’t have any weapons. Here…I, uh. Wow. I’m also out of weapons. Okay. New plan. You still have to destroy the demons, but you have to do it without weapons! Isn’t that great? I thought so. You just have to find the TRIGGER OF DOOM and all the demons will vanquish. Understood? Good. Now, do it!

### Controls

Arrow Keys. That's all there is. Pick up the keys and hearts by walking over them.
